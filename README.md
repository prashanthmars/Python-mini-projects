# Python-mini-projects
Placeholder for  python mini projects that were a part of the Udemy Python course

There are totally 100 projects.
Idea is to upload the solution for them in this space. I will be trying to upload a few every week and try to be consistent.

Feel free to pull the examples from here for your learning. Practice these on your own and use the uploaded solutions as just another reference for one of the multiple solutions that is possible for most of the problems.
